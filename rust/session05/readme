functions and closures
* functions are declared with a name using the fn keyword
    + can be nested
    + nested functions are what python calls closures
* closures are anonymous function-like construct you can store in a variable
    + their practical use is mostly with iterators for e.g. map, filter, reduce
    + python has lambda functions but they are limited to one statement on a single line
