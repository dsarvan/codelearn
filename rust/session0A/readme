Error handling

* Rust does not support Exceptions
* uses Result<T, E> ro return value or error
* or Option<T> for optional values
* errors can bubble up this way too, user has to do it
* builtin helpers are unwrap(), expect() and ?
* do not use the failure crate (the author himself says so)
    - reason: not based on std::error::Error
    - suggested alternative by author anyhow or his new fehler crate
    - for applications: eyre a fork of anyhow
    - for libraries: thiserror
* see Rust by Example
